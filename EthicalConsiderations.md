# AWS DeepRacer Ethical Considerations

**1. What is the importance of adaptability in a model, and what unprecedented issues may arise by allowing a car to drive itself with an inputted model only?**

&emsp;Autonomous driving, a revolutionary idea within machine learning, has been improved at
an exponential rate for the last few decades. A vast number of different models exist, however
what most models retain in commonality is the training process they require. The reason for this
being that the models must not only prioritize performance, but adaptability as well. A car can
encounter many different styles of road’s, facing different conditions. A model only inputted and
not trained will meet its limitations eventually, whether it be factors like the angle of a road, the
speed limit on a road, or an object scattered on the road, this is why a trained and adaptable
model is crucial.

**2. How does variety in roads and their conditions create limitations on customers and the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles?**

&emsp;Autonomous driving has made significant strides towards daily consumer usage. The
greatest limitation with a self-driving vehicle however is variability and a model's ability to
recognize different structures instantaneously. Machine reaction rates can be drastically better
than a human's. A human's average reaction time to a visual stimulus is about ¼ of a second, and
in most driving accidents fractions of a second can be the difference between evading an impact,
or causing a crash. So why have autonomous vehicles not been implemented worldwide?
Although the reliability of the vehicle may not be of main concern in these scenarios, being able
to react to objects, animals, or people on the road at a similar reaction rate of a human is pivotal.
Weather and geography can also play a crucial role in self-driving. A car's ability to correct
hydroplaning, manage sliding on snow, and navigate tight corners is a prerequisite when
distributing a new technology as important as this. Once all variables are accounted for and the
car's adaptability is nearly identical to a human's then autonomous driving may become an
ordinary part of travel.

**3. What problem is the AWS Deep Racer trying to solve? Who will benefit if the problem is solved, and how will the model help?**

&emsp;Ever since Karl Benz invented the Motorwagen in 1886 traveling was revolutionized and
has remained unchanged for over a century. Although driving has never been safer with more
safety regulations than ever in history, thousands of fatal crashes continue to occur on a yearly
basis. What autonomous driving is trying to accomplish is the improvement of vehicles
dependability, precision, and the diminishment of human-error accidents. Drivers provoke most
of their mistakes when driving due to carelessness and distractions. With a computer automated
driving system these obstacles could be mitigated. Unlike humans, machines do not become
distracted changing the station on the radio, or become drowsy after driving extensive hours.
That is why, in a world where we are on the move the majority of the day, autonomous driving is
the solution we need for reduced accidents and overall safer travel.

**4. Running an overfitted model can be problematic. What types of biases may arise when testing autonomous driving on different tracks/roads?**

&emsp;Different obstacles require distinct, precise maneuvers to evade. A vehicle must be able
to maintain composure and differentiate instantly amongst objects it has been trained with. For
example, an animal may suddenly appear on a blind turn where the car’s visibility is reduced.
When the animal comes into view the vehicle must be able to determine not only that an object is
in the way but what it is. The main reason for this being that different animals may require
different movements. A smaller animal many times can be run over in a worst case scenario.
However, a larger animal like a deer must be evaded at all costs to ensure the passengers safety.
This is why overfitting animals, or weather conditions can become dangerous. Another example
of this can be seen during winter months. A car may be able to relate sunny weather to safe
roads, this however changes when the temperature is below freezing and icy roads must be
accounted for. Being able to accurately make decisions from many factors is what it takes for a
vehicle to be able to drive itself better than any person.
What might we do to mitigate future biases with autonomous driving performance.
There are a plethora of things that can be done to mitigate any biases that may arise when
training a vehicle model. What it really comes down to however is the model's accuracy when
adapting to different situations. To mitigate bias we must increase the rate of recognition, an
example of this can be seen when a vehicle encounters a person. Not all people look the same so
the model must be able to differentiate what is a person. If the model encounters a child it must
recognize it as a human although it may not look like an adult. This can only be done through
extensive training points that the data can use to quickly make decisions on certain situations it
encounters.

**5. Who might be negatively impacted by your analysis? This person or persons might not be directly considered in the analysis, but they might be impacted indirectly.**

&emsp;New technologies implemented to the public do not always have only positive impacts
for everyone. Even when Henry Ford increased the accessibility of the motorized vehicle for
common consumers to enjoy, fatal motorized crashes only grew exponentially. Just like a new
technology, automated cars can not positively impact every potential party at stake. A potential
risk when incorporating self-driving vehicles is job loss, specifically occupations as simple as
delivery services or trailer drivers. Ever since companies like Amazon have taken control,
delivery has become part of our everyday lives. What most people do not realize however is that
these companies employ millions to keep their distribution running smoothly. With access to
self-delivery vehicles that do not require a person to conduct, many companies will turn to
saving more profits by cutting workers. Although examples like this may appear to be an issue
that is a century away it is important to keep in mind there are a lot more people at stake when it
comes to innovation. Being able to control interactions between people-driven cars and
autonomous vehicles can also lead to negative impacts. Taking these things into consideration is
needed in order to transition into a new technology.
